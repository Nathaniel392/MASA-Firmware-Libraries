#MASA Talking Libary Python-side
`telem_file_generator.py` takes in a .csv template file that contains information about what data should be stored as global variables in the firmware, and generates all of the following files based on it:

##globals.h/globals.c
`globals.h` defines all the variables in the .csv as `extern`. `globals.c` initializes all those variables to 0, and has a non-autogenerated section that the user can modify to add their own initializations.

##pack\_telem\_defines.h
`pack_telem_defines` converts all the global variables into bit strings that can be transmitted.

##hotfire\_packet.py
`hotfire_packet.py` contains an `ECparse` class that is used by the GUI to receive data from the microcontroller.
